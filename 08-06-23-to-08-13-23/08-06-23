any error for below?
I went to west vancoucer library and learned some english lesson
I had wondful brunch- pipapple rice 

Yes, there are a few errors in the text you provided:

1. "west vancoucer" should be "West Vancouver."
2. "lesson" should be "lessons" (plural) to match the subject "some English."
3. "wondful" should be "wonderful."
4. "brunch- pipapple rice" is likely a typo, and it should be "brunch - pineapple rice" or "brunch with pineapple rice."

The corrected sentence would be:

"I went to West Vancouver Library and learned some English lessons. I had a wonderful brunch - pineapple rice."
