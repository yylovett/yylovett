 Tuesday ,August 22,2023 Weather：sunny and windy 
  I slept in the guest room last night and tor the first time  
  i had a good night’s sleep in this small room
  i have decided to use this small room as a study room, it’s so quiet and peaceful.
  later i went to the kitchen area and saw my friend brushing her teeth , i asked her if
  she had breakfast ,she seemed hesitant ,so i offered her some yogurt and oatmeal 
  she quickly ate some and headed to school .
  she is stubborn and unwilling to listen to advice from others.
  she doesn’t even seem to know what she wants,
  i’ve decided that i wont’t give her advice next time 
  because i cant learn anything new from her ,instead i need to share some of 
  my experiences with her.
